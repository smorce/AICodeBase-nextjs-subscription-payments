Best Program Requirements:
  Readability:
    - Code should be easy to understand and clear.
    - Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions.
    - Maintain consistent and readable code formatting.
    - Use comments and documentation appropriately to clarify the intent of the code.
  Efficiency:
    - Optimize code to improve performance.
    - Avoid redundant or unnecessary operations.
    - Choose appropriate algorithms and data structures for efficient implementation.
    - Minimize memory usage and CPU utilization.
  Modularity:
    - Divide and organize code into logical functions and classes.
    - Apply proper separation of concerns, ensuring each module has a single responsibility.
    - Keep coupling between modules low and aim for loose coupling.
    - Define clear interfaces to simplify interactions between modules.
  Extensibility:
    - Design for flexibility to accommodate future changes and additions of new features.
    - Apply the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) to allow for extension without modifying existing code.
    - Utilize Dependency Injection (DI) to manage dependencies between modules.
    - Use appropriate design patterns to enhance extensibility and maintainability.
  Best Practices and Design Patterns:
    - Follow established best practices for the specific programming language.
    - Apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication.
    - Adhere to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
    - Use appropriate design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer) to improve code structure and reusability.
  Testing:
    - Conduct thorough unit, integration, and system tests to ensure code quality.
    - Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) to develop tests alongside the code.
    - Utilize mocks and stubs to enhance test independence.
    - Aim for high test coverage to ensure all parts of the code are adequately tested.
  Security:
    - Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    - Perform proper validation and sanitization of user input.
    - Encrypt and store sensitive information securely.
    - Apply the principle of least privilege, granting each component only the necessary permissions.
